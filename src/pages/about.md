# The Basics
Viking Tactical -=VTAC=- is a militaristic gaming organization (or "clan") founded on the principle of Comradery. Our official motto is "Victory Through Comradery" We mostly play shooters and other military and strategy games.

We operate not for profit, but for community. Everything you see has been paid for by the generocity of our own members.

## Founding

In the winter of the year of 2015, a man known as Sigvaldr had an idea. He wanted to take the few close friends he'd made gaming online, group them together, and start a gaming clan.
There were three founding members. One of them has been lost to time; The other has had a troubled history with the clan, but remains among us to this day. There were a few others that signed up shortly after the founding. 

## Philosophy

We believe a community should be built on solid principles. Our Pillars of Principle are Brotherhood/Sisterhood, Never go at it alone, Not one man left behind, and that we will die on our feet rather than live on our knees.
We believe that in the heat of battle, in the depths of the trenches, in the fire of war, you only have two things. Yourself, and the brother/sister at your side. We strongly believe the strongest bonds are those forged
in fire. By building each other up rather than tearing someone down to prop oneself up, we aim to achieve a sense of comradery and community across all our members. We don't want you chasing rank for a power trip, we want you to 
earn it because your brothers and sisters believe you earned it. This is a place for people to make friends, express themselves, and kick some ass together!

## Extra History

Viking Tactical as a name and concept did not actually begin in 2015. It is 8 years older than that, old enough to drink in some countries!

Viking Tactical was the name of Sigvaldr's Call of Duty Competitive team. Him and his team participated in various tournaments and trick-shot competitions. Legend has it they even won an MLG tournament back in black ops 2.
