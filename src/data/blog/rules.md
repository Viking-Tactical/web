## General Rules:
- Play nice. Don't be an asshole
- Respect above all - We're all here to have a good time
- Keep toxic behavior to a minimum. We all get angry, but sometimes things go too far
- Follow your chain of command. Ask those directly above you for help/information
- Do not disobey your chain of command. People are in positions for a reason
- If you have an issue with a superior officer, report it to their direct superior
- The Commander's word is law

## Game-Specific Rules:
- Team-killing is frowned upon regardless of situation
- No serious arguments - If you need to have an argument or things get heated, leave the game and any voice comms
- Voice Comms are usually required, but may be waived in certain situations
- Communication is key, your comrades are your greatest strength
- Follow orders - If there's an issue, save it for later and address a superior officer

## Discord-Specific Rules:
- Mass pinging/tagging is prohibited
- Keep conversation civil
- You may ping a member of command or above to drag the Commander to the Drunk Tank if it is warranted.
