  MESSAGE TO THE FORCES - 24DEC2025, FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
---

Greetings and happy holidays from High-Command! I'd like to take this opportunity to make it clear our current situation and future intentions.
We are ressurecting an old gaming clan by building it from the ground up with our own systems. The only external tool we really rely on is Discord. Most everything else is built in-house.

This of course takes time and effort to complete. While we are making progress, it is slower that I had initially expected. Therefore, as of now, December 24th, 2025. I am announcing CLAN STATUS BETA.
This means the clan is effectively in a "closed beta" type situation where we are technically admitting new recruits, but are not ready for full operation and have not begun recruitment efforts.

If you have anyone interested in joining us while we are in this "work in progress" phase, please do not hesitate to send them a link to the discord and encourage them to apply on the website. 

As a token of my gratitude, upon full operations and opening of our doors, everyone who was present during this Status beta will receive an exclusive role on discord to showcase your early adoption of our great clan.
